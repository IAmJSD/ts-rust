# Notices

ts-rust is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

ts-rust is a port of other projects. Those parts keep their original licenses and notices, so the
crates and npm packages say `MIT AND Apache-2.0`.

## TypeScript

Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

- The compiler source in `crates/` is a Rust port of the native TypeScript compiler (Go), from
  [microsoft/TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) and
  [microsoft/typescript-go](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go). We changed it: it is
  rewritten in Rust. [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) records the upstream revision.
- The lib files (`crates/ts_goport/libs`), the localized diagnostic messages
  (`crates/ts_goport/data/loc`) and the JS launcher and JS API in the npm packages are copied from
  TypeScript without change.

- The AST schema (`tools/ts_ast_codegen/spec`) is copied from TypeScript, with edits for the Rust
  code generator ([PROVENANCE.md](tools/ts_ast_codegen/spec/PROVENANCE.md)).
